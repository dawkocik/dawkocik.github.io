      "A developer portfolio design project made for Kacper Soja using Figma and Notion. The user interface is designed to be modern and provide a clean look, while still being informative to help the developer showcase their skills. The idea was to create a portfolio page that was clean and easy to navigate, allowing a visitor to quickly get an idea of the developerâ€™s skillset. This can be done by providing them with a short description of what each project is about and then linking to more detailed information about it on the website.",
